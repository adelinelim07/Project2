# Project 2: Full-Stack Application
## Objective
1. Creating a dashboard which tracks portfolio of aircraft
   - Monitor asset quality 
   - Monitor credit exposure



## Description
1. MVC
   - Models: (1) Aircraft (2) Lessees
   - Views: Logged in views editable 
   - Controllers: One per model 
2. Full CRUD 
3. Used EJS partials for both head & body
3. Included sign up/ login functionality, with encrypted passwords



## The approach taken
1. Came up with wireframe of dashboard page I intended to have
2. Listed specs and functions I wanted 



## Unsolved problems
1. Manufactured Date in edit ejs not able to show up in right format
2. When lessee is deleted, aircraft tied to deleted lessee becomes uneditable and needs to be deleted. Need to amend model
3. Not able to slice array in model which references to an amended model 
4. Edit EJS inputs are string input fields instead of dropdown selection
